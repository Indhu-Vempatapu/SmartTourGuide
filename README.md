# Tourist Recommendation Expert System
This is an **AI-based rule-driven web application** that provides **personalized travel recommendations** to users based on their interests and preferences. It is powered by a **forward chaining expert system** built using Python's *experta* library and served via a **Flask web interface**.

# Project Functionality
- Collects tourist preferences via a simple web form.

- Uses forward chaining (data-driven inference) to match inputs with a rich set of tourism-related rules.

- Generates destination recommendations across multiple categories like:

  - Historical places

  - Adventure sports

  - Festivals and culture

  - Art and architecture

  - Nature and wildlife

  - Food, music, and more

- Eliminates duplicate suggestions with a clean result view.

# üîó How Forward Chaining Works Here
The system uses the *experta* library (a Python port of CLIPS) to define a knowledge base and rules. When a user selects preferences, **facts** are declared and matched with **rules** using forward chaining:

  - Inputs ‚Üí Facts (TouristInterests)

  - Rules fire if conditions match

  - Matching rules append specific recommendations

  - Final list of destinations is presented to the user

This approach makes the system scalable and modular‚Äîjust add new rules for new features.
